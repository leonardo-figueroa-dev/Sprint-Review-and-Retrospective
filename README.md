Reflection
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by breaking them down into simple goals and actions the software should complete. Creating user stories helps me think from the user’s point of view and understand what they actually want, not just what I think they need. It makes development more focused and helps me design features that solve real problems.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like approaching development in small, manageable steps. Using Agile helps me stay flexible and adjust as I go. I plan to keep using things like sprints, daily stand ups, and retrospectives in future projects because they keep everyone on track and make it easier to handle changes. I’ve learned that reviewing progress often helps catch problems early.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, supporting others, and staying open to feedback. It’s also about staying reliable and finishing your part on time so the team can move forward together. In Agile, teamwork is huge; everyone depends on each other, so being honest and helpful makes the whole team stronger.

Portfolio Note

This artifact shows how I applied Agile and Scrum concepts to manage a software project from start to finish. It highlights my understanding of user stories, sprints, retrospectives, and how teamwork leads to better results.
